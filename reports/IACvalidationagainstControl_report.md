# ðŸ“‹ POLICY VALIDATION RESULTS

To evaluate the compliance of the Terraform code against the provided Rego policy, we need to focus on the ECS task definitions and their image tags. The Rego policy specifies that ECS tasks must use the "stable" image tag, and any other tag, such as "latest" or "dev", is considered unapproved.

### Analysis of Terraform Code:

1. **Terraform ECS Task Definition:**
   - The Terraform code defines an ECS task using the `aws_ecs_task_definition` resource.
   - The image for the container is specified using the `var.image` variable, which is a Docker image URI.

2. **Rego Policy:**
   - The policy checks for ECS task definitions and ensures that the image tag is "stable".
   - The policy explicitly flags any image tag that is not "stable" as a violation.

3. **terraform.json Input:**
   - The input JSON for policy evaluation includes two ECS task definitions:
     - `payment-task` with the image tag "latest".
     - `audit-task` with the image tag "stable".

### Evaluation:

- **Non-compliant Resource:**
  - The `payment-task` is non-compliant because it uses the image tag "latest", which is not approved according to the policy.
  - The policy requires the image tag to be "stable".

- **Compliant Resource:**
  - The `audit-task` is compliant as it uses the approved image tag "stable".

### Recommendation to Fix Non-compliance:

To ensure compliance with the policy, the image tag for the `payment-task` should be changed from "latest" to "stable". This can be done by updating the Docker image URI in the Terraform code or the associated variable to use the "stable" tag.

### Conclusion:

The Terraform code is partially compliant with the Rego policy. The `payment-task` violates the policy due to its use of the "latest" image tag, while the `audit-task` is compliant. To achieve full compliance, ensure all ECS task definitions use the "stable" image tag.
