## Detailed Policy Evaluations

### Non-Compliant Policies

#### ARC-POLICY-103 - ❌ NON-COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: No

Deviations:
- 1: The UML diagram indicates that the `MandateUpdateService` container directly accesses the `ThoughtMachine` external system. This violates the policy, which explicitly states that only the `VaultCoreClient` adapter is allowed to connect to the `ThoughtMachine` external system. The policy aims to prevent tight coupling to external APIs and promote testability and abstraction.

Suggestions:
- 1: Modify the architecture so that the `MandateUpdateService` does not directly interact with the `ThoughtMachine` external system. Instead, ensure that all interactions with `ThoughtMachine` are routed through the `VaultCoreClient` adapter. This can be achieved by having the `MandateUpdateService` call the `VaultCoreClient` for any operations that require access to `ThoughtMachine`. This change will align the architecture with the policy requirements by ensuring that the adapter pattern is used for external API access.

### Compliant Policies

#### ARC-POLICY-101 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. All microservices (WebAPI, ServiceLayer, VaultCoreClient) are defined within a system boundary labeled "ECS Fargate Cluster," which satisfies the policy requirement that microservices must reside in a `System_Boundary` named for Fargate or ECS. Therefore, there are no deviations from the policy, and no suggestions for changes are necessary.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-102 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram adheres to the provided OPA policy. The policy mandates that all external systems must interact through a defined API Gateway container, preventing direct backend access. The relationships in the UML diagram show that the external system "ClientApp" interacts with the "ApiGateway" first, which then forwards requests to the backend components. This setup complies with the policy requirements, ensuring proper access control and monitoring through the API Gateway.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-104 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the policy ARC-POLICY-104. The container `VaultCoreClient`, which makes external calls to `ThoughtMachine`, is correctly annotated with the stereotype `<<uses_secret>>`, indicating that it uses secrets for external communication. Therefore, there are no deviations from the policy requirements.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-105 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the provided OPA policy. The policy requires the architecture to include a data store related to audit or logging, specifically using PostgreSQL or RDS technology, and the UML diagram includes an "Audit Log" container using "Amazon RDS PostgreSQL" with the stereotype "data_store". This satisfies the policy requirement, and there are no deviations from the policy logic.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-106 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

Conclusion: The UML diagram complies with the policy ARC-POLICY-106. The architecture explicitly includes a component named "AWS Secrets Manager" with the stereotype "secrets_store," fulfilling the policy requirement for a secrets management component.

---

#### ARC-POLICY-108 - ✅ COMPLIANT

**Evaluation Details:**
Compliance: Yes

Deviations:
- None

Suggestions:
- None

The UML diagram complies with the policy ARC-POLICY-108. The diagram includes a container labeled "Amazon CloudWatch" with the stereotype "observability," which satisfies the policy requirement for having at least one observability component. Therefore, there are no deviations from the policy, and no suggestions for changes are necessary.
