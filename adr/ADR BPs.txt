**Best Practices for Writing Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)** ensure that design decisions are well-documented, traceable, and useful across the software development lifecycle. Here are the key principles and best practices:

---

### ?? 1. **Follow a Standard Template**

Use a consistent structure for all ADRs. The commonly accepted format includes:

```
# Title
## Status
(e.g., Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)

## Context
What is the background? What problem are you trying to solve?

## Decision
What decision did you make and why?

## Consequences
What are the implications, trade-offs, or follow-up actions?

## Alternatives Considered (optional)
Other options you evaluated and why they were rejected.

## Related ADRs (optional)
Links to other related or superseded ADRs.
```

---

### ?? 2. **Use Plain Language**

Avoid jargon. Write for your future self and other stakeholders (e.g., developers, architects, auditors) who may not be familiar with the decision.

---

### ?? 3. **Keep it Short and Focused**

One decision per ADR. If a new decision modifies or builds on another, create a new ADR and reference the original.

---

### ?? 4. **Make It Immutable**

Once accepted, don’t edit an ADR to change history. If the decision changes, create a new ADR that supersedes the old one. Mark the original as "Superseded."

---

### ?? 5. **Record the Rationale**

Document the *why*, not just the *what*. The value of an ADR is in understanding *why* the team made that choice at that time, including constraints and priorities.

---

### ?? 6. **Version-Control ADRs**

Store ADRs in the same source control repo as your code (e.g., `/adr/` directory). This keeps decisions close to implementation and ensures traceability.

---

### ?? 7. **Use Sequential Filenames**

Name ADRs using a numbered prefix (e.g., `0001-use-postgresql.md`, `0002-switch-to-kafka.md`). This preserves order and history.

---

### ?? 8. **Review and Approve**

Discuss ADRs with team members. Ideally, get explicit team or architectural governance approval before marking them as "Accepted."

---

### ?? 9. **Link to Implementation**

When possible, cross-reference ADRs in code comments or CI/CD pipelines. For example, an ADR approving a tool like ArchUnit could be linked in test classes validating architectural constraints.

---

### ?? 10. **Revisit Periodically**

Schedule regular reviews of your ADRs (e.g., during quarterly tech reviews) to see if any are outdated or should be superseded.
