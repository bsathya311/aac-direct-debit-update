# Use Spring Boot as application framework

## Status
Accepted

## Context
We need a modern, production-grade framework to develop microservices rapidly with minimal boilerplate.

## Decision
We chose Spring Boot due to its proven ecosystem, modular design, rich dependency injection support, and first-class support for REST APIs, testing, and security.

## Consequences
Rapid development, rich library support, and alignment with enterprise standards. Spring Boot conventions reduce setup time and improve maintainability.
