## Non-Compliant Modules and Remediation Steps

### observability-module

| Category                                              | Details                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Components Present in PUML Diagram and Terraform Code    | CloudWatch                                                     |
| Components Present in PUML Diagram Not in Terraform Code | None                                                           |
| Components Present in Terraform Code Not in PUML Diagram | aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm, aws_cloudwatch_log_group          |
| Connection Discrepancies                                 | MandateUpdateService -> CloudWatch and VaultCoreClient -> CloudWatch connections are not explicitly defined in Terraform code. |
| Label/Annotation Discrepancies                           | None                                                           |

#### Remediation Steps:

1. **[Define Connections]:**
   - Ensure that the connections from MandateUpdateService and VaultCoreClient to CloudWatch are explicitly defined in the Terraform code. This could involve setting up log streams or metrics that correspond to these components.

2. **[Align Resources with Diagram]:**
   - Review the architecture diagram to ensure that the resources such as `aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm` and `aws_cloudwatch_log_group` are accurately represented or justified within the context of the observability module. If necessary, update the diagram to reflect these resources or adjust the Terraform code to align with the intended architecture.

### rds-secrets-module

| Category                                              | Details                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Components Present in PUML Diagram and Terraform Code    | Secrets Manager, Audit Log (Amazon RDS PostgreSQL)              |
| Components Present in PUML Diagram Not in Terraform Code | None                                                            |
| Components Present in Terraform Code Not in PUML Diagram | aws_db_subnet_group.this                                        |
| Connection Discrepancies                                 | MandateUpdateController -> Secrets Manager connection not explicitly defined in Terraform code. |
| Label/Annotation Discrepancies                           | None                                                            |

#### Remediation Steps:

1. **Connection Definition:**
   - Ensure IAM roles and policies are defined to allow MandateUpdateController to read secrets from Secrets Manager.
   - Verify that the MandateUpdateService has the necessary permissions and configurations to write to the Audit Log (Amazon RDS PostgreSQL).

2. **Documentation and Code Alignment:**
   - Update Terraform code to include explicit IAM role and policy definitions for the MandateUpdateController's access to Secrets Manager.
   - Review and document the connection between MandateUpdateService and Audit Log in Terraform code to ensure it matches the diagram.

### security-module

| Category                                              | Details                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Components Present in PUML Diagram and Terraform Code    | None                                                            |
| Components Present in PUML Diagram Not in Terraform Code | Amazon API Gateway                                              |
| Components Present in Terraform Code Not in PUML Diagram | aws_security_group.ecs, aws_security_group.alb, aws_security_group.rds |
| Connection Discrepancies                                 | Amazon API Gateway -> MandateUpdateController (Spring Boot): HTTPS Route not implemented in Terraform code |
| Label/Annotation Discrepancies                           | None                                                            |

#### Remediation Steps:

1. **Add Amazon API Gateway Resource:**
   - Define an `aws_api_gateway_rest_api` resource in the Terraform code to represent the Amazon API Gateway component.
   - Ensure the API Gateway is configured to route requests to the MandateUpdateController (Spring Boot) component.

2. **Implement Connection:**
   - Establish the connection between the Amazon API Gateway and the MandateUpdateController using Terraform resources such as `aws_api_gateway_integration` and `aws_api_gateway_method`.
   - Ensure the connection uses HTTPS as specified in the architecture diagram.
