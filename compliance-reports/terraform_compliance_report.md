## Module Compliance Summary

| Module Name | Status | Action Required |
|-------------|--------|----------------|
| ecs-fargate-module | ✅ COMPLIANT | No |
| observability-module | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | Yes |
| rds-secrets-module | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | Yes |
| security-module | ❌ NON-COMPLIANT | Yes |

## Non-Compliant Modules and Remediation Steps

### observability-module

| Category                                              | Details                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Components Present in PUML Diagram and Terraform Code    | CloudWatch                                                     |
| Components Present in PUML Diagram Not in Terraform Code | None                                                           |
| Components Present in Terraform Code Not in PUML Diagram | aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm, aws_cloudwatch_log_group          |
| Connection Discrepancies                                 | MandateUpdateService and VaultCoreClient connections to CloudWatch are not explicitly defined in Terraform code. |
| Label/Annotation Discrepancies                           | None                                                           |

#### Remediation Steps:

1. **[Connection Definitions]:**
   - Ensure that the connections from MandateUpdateService and VaultCoreClient to CloudWatch are explicitly defined in the Terraform code. This could involve adding resources or configurations that capture logs and metrics from these services to CloudWatch.

2. **[Resource Alignment]:**
   - Align the Terraform resources with the architecture diagram by ensuring that the aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm and aws_cloudwatch_log_group are appropriately linked to the components in the diagram, reflecting their intended use for observability.

### rds-secrets-module

| Category                                              | Details                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Components Present in PUML Diagram and Terraform Code    | Secrets Manager, Audit Log (Amazon RDS PostgreSQL)              |
| Components Present in PUML Diagram Not in Terraform Code | None                                                            |
| Components Present in Terraform Code Not in PUML Diagram | aws_db_subnet_group.this                                        |
| Connection Discrepancies                                 | MandateUpdateController -> Secrets Manager connection not explicitly defined in Terraform code. |
| Label/Annotation Discrepancies                           | None                                                            |

#### Remediation Steps:

1. **Connection Definition:**
   - Ensure IAM roles and policies are defined to allow MandateUpdateController to read secrets from Secrets Manager.
   - Verify that the MandateUpdateService has the necessary permissions and configurations to write to the Audit Log (Amazon RDS PostgreSQL).

2. **Documentation and Code Alignment:**
   - Update Terraform code to include explicit IAM role and policy definitions for accessing Secrets Manager.
   - Ensure that the Terraform code reflects all necessary security configurations for the RDS instance, including subnet and security group settings.

### security-module

| Category                                              | Details                                                         |
|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Components Present in PUML Diagram and Terraform Code    | None                                                            |
| Components Present in PUML Diagram Not in Terraform Code | Amazon API Gateway                                              |
| Components Present in Terraform Code Not in PUML Diagram | aws_security_group.ecs, aws_security_group.alb, aws_security_group.rds |
| Connection Discrepancies                                 | Amazon API Gateway -> MandateUpdateController (Spring Boot): HTTPS Route is not implemented in Terraform code |
| Label/Annotation Discrepancies                           | No explicit labels or annotations for Amazon API Gateway in Terraform code |

#### Remediation Steps:

1. **[Add Missing Component]:**
   - Implement a Terraform resource for Amazon API Gateway to reflect its presence in the architecture diagram.

2. **[Implement Missing Connection]:**
   - Define the connection from Amazon API Gateway to MandateUpdateController (Spring Boot) using appropriate Terraform resources or modules to establish the HTTPS Route.

3. **[Review Security Groups]:**
   - Ensure that the security groups defined in the Terraform code are necessary and correctly associated with the components in the architecture diagram. If they are not part of the "security-module", consider moving them to the appropriate module.
